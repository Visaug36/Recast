/**
 * Every conversion Recast performs in one step.
 *
 * This is a list of **edges**, not of pairs. Most pairs Recast offers are two of
 * these run back to back — `routing.ts` computes those. Adding a format here
 * means declaring its edges to the nearest existing format and letting routing
 * reach the rest; fourteen formats would otherwise be 182 hand-written
 * converters.
 *
 * Each family has a hub that everything else connects through: Markdown for
 * text documents, Excel for spreadsheets. A new format needs a reader to the
 * hub and a writer from it, and it is reachable from everything in its family.
 *
 * There are deliberately no `import()` calls here. This module is reached from
 * the page, and a dynamic import in it makes the page's bundler emit a chunk
 * for every engine — several megabytes that the page then never loads, because
 * conversions happen in the worker. The engines live in `engines.ts`, which
 * only the worker imports. `index.test.ts` keeps the two in step.
