/**
 * pdfmake with its bundled Roboto, embedded in the file.
 *
 * Recast used the base-14 Helvetica before, which costs nothing to ship because
 * every PDF reader already has the face. But a base-14 font is addressed with a
 * single-byte encoding roughly the size of Latin-1, so anything above U+00FF had
 * nowhere to render from: `Καλημέρα` came out as `9£±;³·;Ã-<`, and the
 * conversion reported success. Roboto is embedded, so the glyphs travel with the
 * document.
 *
 * Roboto covers Latin, Greek and Cyrillic — 927 code points, identical across
 * all four styles. Everything else it cannot draw, which is what COVERAGE below
 * is for.
