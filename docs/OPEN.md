# Open

Everything outstanding, with why it is open and who owns it.

**When something closes it moves to `DECISIONS.md`, it is not deleted.** A
resolved question is a decision, and the reasoning that closed it is exactly what
a future session needs in order not to reopen it.

---

## Yours

One thing nothing in this repo can do. The default branch flip and the
`github-pages` branch policy are both done — see `DECISIONS.md` for what they
cost and what now guards against a repeat.

### Test the iOS memory threshold on a real phone

`lib/files/capacity.ts` assumes **350 MB** for a WebKit mobile tab and says so in
the code. It is a guess, marked as a guess, and the warning copy tells the user
it is an estimate rather than a measurement. Safari exposes neither
`performance.memory` nor `navigator.deviceMemory`, so this cannot be measured
from inside the browser — only by converting a large file on a device and seeing
whether the tab survives.

It matters because iOS does not throw when a tab runs out of memory; it kills the
tab. There is no error to catch and nothing to report, which is why the check is
a pre-flight rather than a recovery.

## Deferred, with reasons

Open because of a decision, not an oversight. Each one names what would have to
change.

### Right-to-left has no PDF path

Arabic and Hebrew are reported, not rendered. fontkit can shape Arabic, but
nothing in the stack implements the Unicode bidirectional algorithm.

**Why it stays open:** a bidi bug looks entirely correct to anyone who does not
read the script. This is the one failure mode Recast cannot self-verify.

**What would change it:** a UAX #9 implementation _and_ someone who reads the
script to check the output. The second is the binding constraint.

### x2t: build size unmeasured, licence undecided

The write-up is at `docs/x2t-spike.md` on branch `spike/x2t-wasm`.

**Why it stays open:** two blockers. The build needs Docker and roughly 20 GB, so
the `.wasm` size is unknown and a figure from memory would be worse than none.
And CryptPad's vendored ONLYOFFICE core is **AGPL-3.0**, which would reach Recast's
own source — the only irreversible part of adopting it.

**What would change it:** one afternoon with Docker for the numbers, then your
answer on the licence. If the licence is unacceptable this is a _reject_, and the
refused pairs stay honestly unsupported, which is already how the interface
explains itself.

### Merged table cells flatten, and the layout does not survive

A cell spanning two columns becomes one cell in a plain grid. The text survives
and a warning names it — the silent part was fixed in stage 5 — but the structure
does not.

**Why it stays open:** every writer Recast has writes a plain grid. Carrying spans
would mean a span model through five writers.

### The block model carries no inline runs

Every reader carries bold, italics and links into Markdown; every writer except
HTML drops them. Each affected pair's caveat says so.

**Why it stays open:** it touches six writers and is a much larger job than it
looks. `_md.ts` says so at the point where it strips them.

**What would change it:** a run model in `Block`, and then six writers taught to
honour it. Not a casual fix, and the caveats are currently honest.

### Four pairs need three hops and so do not exist

`json` to `odt`, `rtf`, `html` and `epub`. Two steps is the rule.

**Why it stays open:** not a defect. Recorded so nobody rediscovers it as one.
ODS has no such gap because it shares its text-side edges with XLSX; JSON's
reader is genuinely its own, so it has a single edge into the text family.

### `pdf → md` and `rtf → md` infer structure, and there is a ceiling

Heading levels are ranked by size; PDF paragraphs split where the line gap
exceeds about twice the type size. Both are real improvements on the fixed ratios
they replaced.

**Why it stays open:** what neither can do is tell a pull quote set large from a
heading, or two short paragraphs at normal leading from one wrapped paragraph.
Both also assume ordinary body text is the commonest size in the document, so a
page that is mostly headings reads its own body size wrong. The caveats say so;
do not claim more.

## Noticed, not yet decided

Small, real, and waiting for the right stage rather than for a decision.

### Per-pair pages are sketched in the design and do not exist

`design/Recast.dc.html` has a `/pdf-to-markdown` screen: one page per pair, with
what survives, what does not, and a drop zone scoped to it. That is 114 pages,
and the four "Most used" links on the home screen point at them — which is why
those links were cut rather than built.

**Why it stays open:** it is a stage, not a detail. The content is already in
the registry, so the pages would be generated rather than written, but routing,
titles, the sitemap and what a pair page says when a pair is refused are all
decisions nobody has made.

**What would change it:** your call on whether the matrix is enough. It answers
the same question in one page.

### Twenty-nine caveat claims have no fixture to act on

`lib/registry/caveats.test.ts` checks 111 claims against real output and
reports what it cannot reach. Twenty-nine are about a feature no fixture has —
a chart, an image, cell formatting, a formula in an `.ods`. Each is a fixture
away from being checked, and the list is snapshotted so it can only shrink
deliberately.

**Why it stays open:** not a defect, and not urgent. It is the honest measure of
how much of the promise surface is actually covered, and it is written down
instead of being rounded up to "the caveats are tested".

**What would change it:** richer fixtures. A workbook with a chart and a merged
cell, a deck with an image and a speaker note, a Markdown file with a raw HTML
block.

### Three promises are broken, and pinned rather than corrected

`docx → rtf` claims emphasis survives, and it does not. `md → docx` claims
quotes and code blocks map to Word styles, and they get direct formatting
instead. Both are listed in `BROKEN` in `lib/registry/caveats.test.ts`, so the
suite is honest rather than green.

**Why it stays open:** the first is the inline-run gap, and the sentence should
be corrected rather than the writer. The second is a real gap — `md → odt`
writes the real OpenDocument styles, so the Word writer is the odd one out —
and that is a change to the writer.

**What would change it:** yours to say which way each goes. The evidence is in
the comment beside each line.
