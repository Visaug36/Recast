/**
 * Asserts that a push to the publishing branch actually published *this* build.
 *
 * Written because run #20 was green and published nothing. The deploy job is
 * gated on a condition, a job whose condition is false is `skipped`, and a
 * skipped job does not fail a run — so the workflow reported success, no
 * deployment record was ever created, and the live site stayed three days old.
 * Nothing in the run said so.
 *
 * Two questions, both asked against the deployed site rather than the workflow's
 * own opinion of itself:
 *
 *   1. Did the deploy job run at all, on a branch where it had to?
 *   2. Is the thing now being served this commit, at the path it belongs at?
 *
 * The second is the one that matters. A deploy can succeed and still leave the
 * wrong bytes at the URL — a stale CDN, a basePath baked for a different
 * repository name — and every check that reads the workflow instead of the site
 * would still be green.
