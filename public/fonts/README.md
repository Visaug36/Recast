# The CJK fonts

`NotoSansJP.ttf`, `NotoSansSC.ttf` and `NotoSansKR.ttf` are what Recast embeds
when a document contains Chinese, Japanese or Korean text and the target is
PDF. Roboto, which every other PDF uses, has no CJK glyphs at all.

They are served from Recast's own origin like every other font here: nothing is
fetched from a CDN, and the worker only asks for one when a conversion actually
needs it.

## Where they came from

Noto Sans JP 5.3.0, Noto Sans SC 5.2.8 and Noto Sans KR 5.3.0 — the
`japanese`, `chinese-simplified` and `korean` subsets published by
[Fontsource](https://fontsource.org), which repackages Google's Noto. All three
are licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 — the full text is in
`OFL.txt`.

Fontsource ships `.woff2`. These are the same fonts converted to `.ttf`:

```bash
python3 -c "
from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont
f = TTFont('noto-sans-jp-japanese-400-normal.woff2'); f.flavor = None
f.save('NotoSansJP.ttf')"
```

## Why TTF and not the smaller woff2

woff2 halves the download — 0.97 MB against 2.25 MB for the Japanese face — and
pdfmake accepts either. But pdfkit only subsets a font it can read through
fontkit's TrueType path, and a woff2 goes down a path that embeds the **whole**
face in every file it writes. The same three-line test document came out at

| Font shipped | Download | PDF produced |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| `.woff2`     | 0.97 MB  | 2988 KB      |
| `.ttf`       | 2.25 MB  | 14 KB        |

The download happens once a session; the bloat would happen in every file a
person converts and keeps. So TTF, and the extra 1.3 MB is the price.

## Why three files and not one pan-CJK font

A pan-CJK face is three to four times the size, and almost nobody needs two of
them at once. Recast picks by what is in the document: hangul means Korean,
otherwise kana means Japanese, otherwise Simplified Chinese. Each is fetched on
its own, so a Japanese document never downloads the Korean face, and a document
with no CJK in it downloads none of them.

## What each one covers

Read out of the font's own `cmap` at load time rather than from a table that
could drift — `readCmap` in `lib/registry/converters/_cjk.ts`, checked against
fontTools for all three.

| Face       | Code points | Han | Hangul | Kana |
| ---------- | ----------- | --- | ------ | ---- |
| NotoSansJP | 6886        | yes | no     | yes  |
| NotoSansSC | 7946        | yes | no     | no   |
| NotoSansKR | 11541       | no  | yes    | no   |

**The Korean face carries no Han**, and only one face is embedded per document,
so a Korean document quoting hanja loses the hanja — replaced, and named in a
warning. Choosing Korean for a document written in Korean is still right: the
other way round loses every syllable of it.
